The Superstore Sales dataset comprises 9,800 transactions recorded from Jan 2015, through Jan 2019.
It brings together order details (order and ship dates, ship mode), customer profiles (ID, name, segment), product hierarchies (category, sub-category) and geographic attributes (city, state, region), all tied to transaction-level sales figures.
This rich, multi-dimensional dataset provides a solid foundation for uncovering seasonal trends, regional performance variations and segment-specific insights, and supports the creation of an interactive Power BI dashboard to drive actionable, data-driven recommendations.
